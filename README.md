# Server

This is the docker branch. It's so I could try to launch the server with docker.

A simple http server. Just put whatever you want to serve in the page folder.

## build
It only depends on the standard library so the ```run.sh``` script should work.

**NOTE:** I wrote this in C, and only tested it on a private network, so I'm sure it's wildly unsafe.
